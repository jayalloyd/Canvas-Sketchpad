# Canvas-Sketchpad
🎨 Sketchpad – Canvas Drawing App

A simple HTML5 Canvas Drawing App where you can sketch freely in your browser.
Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project demonstrates basic canvas rendering, event handling, and DOM manipulation.

🚀 Features

✍️ Draw on a canvas using your mouse (touch support can be added).

🧽 Clear the entire canvas with a single button.

🎨 Smooth rounded strokes with customizable stroke width & color.

📱 Works on modern browsers with responsive design in mind.

⚡ Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jayalloyd/Canvas-Sketchpad
cd Canvas-Sketchpad

2. Open the project

Simply open the index.html file in your browser:

open index.html


(or drag & drop into a browser window)

🛠️ How It Works

A <canvas> element (drawingCanvas) is used for rendering.

Mouse/touch events (mousedown, mousemove, mouseup, etc.) will be tracked for drawing.

The Clear Canvas button resets the canvas with ctx.clearRect().
